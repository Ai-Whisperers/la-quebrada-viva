## Open tasks (ranked; pick from the top unless told otherwise)

### Scene completeness
1. **Wire `scatter_grass_tufts`** — exists in `lqv/flora/bamboo.py` but is never called from the driver/`flora.populate`. Decide placement, respect the RNG-order invariant (append after existing calls, never insert between).
2. **Variant B valley mist** — brief requires mist near the cliff for B; only the variant-agnostic canopy volume exists. Add a B-only ground-fog volume in `lqv/lighting.py`.
3. **Lapacho trunk material** — uses `MAT['mango_trunk']`; give lapacho its own bark material (flagged in `lqv/flora/lapacho.py` docstring).
4. **Stream zones** — brief defines 5 zones (gorge, flat sandstone pool, colonial weir, channeled riparian, bamboo belt); code has a straight channel + pool + cascades. The **weir** is the biggest visible gap (also rule 7's micro-hydro anchor).
5. **Anthurium epiphytes** — in species list, not modelled.
6. **Rule-7/9/10 props for detail shots** — micro-hydro at weir, solar on separate steel frame, meshed cistern. Needed before any close-up/detail finals.
7. **Pindo trunk texture** — retained leaf bases (rough trunk), currently smooth + noise.

### Pipeline
8. **Variant C (night/blue hour, fireflies)** — extend `lqv/lighting.py` (moonlight + emission particles + window glow), add C exposure in driver, then extend the manifest to 18 finals. Until then `RENDER_VARIANT=C` crashes after a full build.
9. **Early variant validation** — `lqv/config.py` should reject unknown variants at parse time instead of crashing post-build in lighting.py.
10. **Warn on unknown RENDER_RES** instead of silent preview fallback (`lqv/config.py`).

### Housekeeping
11. ~~`wesly.txt` / `render.png` cleanup~~ DONE 2026-06-09: `wesly.txt` moved out of the project, `render.png` + pre-refactor backups moved to `_archive/` (ignored by git and Claude). Reference docs now live in `docs/`.

## Decisions log

- 2026-06-09: Deliverable target set to **12 finals** (A/B×6); Variant C deferred to task 8. Samples policy fixed: 128 preview / 512 hero finals / 256 other finals. No 4K preset — prompt docs' "4K minimum" deferred until requested.
- 2026-06-09: Variant A sun elevation kept at 13° (code) vs 20° (brief) — deliberate aesthetic call.
- 2026-06-09: Git initialized; scene.blend untracked (regenerable from code); final renders tracked.

## Environment

- Blender 4.2.3 LTS on PATH; Cycles GPU autodetect exists in `lqv/engine.py` but **this machine renders on CPU** — AMD RX 6400 (Navi 24) + Vega iGPU present, no ROCm/HIP runtime installed (verified 2026-06-09: `device=CPU backend=None`). Budget render times accordingly. Optional speedup: install AMD's HIP runtime (system-level, sudo — Ivan's call).
- blender-mcp available for interactive work; Poly Haven via MCP.
