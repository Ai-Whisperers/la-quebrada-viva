# Credits — Riverstone Valley

Attribution for third-party assets used in the render pipeline. Update this file as assets land in `assets/models/`; remove entries when assets are removed from the scene.

CC0 assets (Poly Haven HDRIs and PBR textures) do not legally require attribution but are listed here for traceability.

### Phase 8 — Paraguayan detail props (PLANNED, not yet imported)

## Hyper3D / Hunyuan3D generated assets

These are generated procedurally from text prompts; no third-party attribution required. Listed for reproducibility — prompts archived in `docs/asset_plan.md` §C.4. Each generated asset must record `generator`, `prompt`, and `seed` at generation time so the output can be regenerated bit-for-bit (or close to it, given upstream model drift).

- **[PLANNED]** `lapacho_A.blend` — Handroanthus impetiginosus, bare + pink bloom
  - generator: Hyper3D Rodin
  - prompt: see `docs/asset_plan.md` §C.4 — "Lapacho A"
  - seed: TBD-at-generation (record back here once the job lands)
- **[PLANNED]** `lapacho_B.blend` — Handroanthus impetiginosus, fully leafed
  - generator: Hyper3D Rodin
  - prompt: see `docs/asset_plan.md` §C.4 — "Lapacho B"
  - seed: TBD-at-generation (record back here once the job lands)

### Cross-references

- `LICENSE_BUNDLE.md` (repo root) — per-license summary and bundle-readiness checklist.
- `LICENSES/README.md` — verbatim CC0 + CC-BY 4.0 legal-code mirror, with vendor-terms pointer table.
- `docs/license_obligations.md` — how each license is satisfied at publication time.
- `docs/asset_plan.md` §C.4 — full prompt archive (Lapacho A / B / Thatch + procedural-recipe notes for Variant C emission elements).
- `docs/external_assets.md` — download log and `[USED]` / `[PLANNED]` status for every Sketchfab + Poly Haven asset listed above.
- `docs/wesley_deliverable_bundle.md` §Tier 2 — this file ships in the Tier-2 USB / cloud bundle alongside `LICENSE_BUNDLE.md` and `LICENSES/README.md`; the triple together satisfies CC-BY 4.0 attribution at distribution time. Added 2026-06-10 to close the back-pointer asymmetry.
- `STATUS.md` — render manifest + open-task ledger; the source of truth for which `[PLANNED]` Sketchfab/Hyper3D entries above actually got wired into the build vs deferred behind the MCP-socket block.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` §"Variant C additions (2026-06-10)" — code-side index of the three procedural recipes (fireflies, window-glow emission planes, Variant C lighting branch) that explain why this file gains *zero* new third-party rows for Variant C.
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — narrative log of the 2026-06-10 mega-session including Variant C implementation + per-cam render-loop architecture decision; each `[USED]` entry in this file maps to an asset-import action recorded there.
- `CLAUDE.md` §"Material color references" + §"Plant species — critical accuracy notes" — the photographic constants this file's `[PLANNED]` reference rows must respect; e.g., pindo plumose-droop is mandated, so any Sketchfab pindo model added here must be visually verified against that spec before its row flips from `[PLANNED]` to `[USED]`.
